Server.js: In the server.js, we provide login, register and logout functions, using the cookie session for authentication. Besides, we provide task search (By title or status), create task, update task and delete task functions which fulfill the CRUD requirement. In the end, we provide RESTful API service so we can use CURL methods (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE).
